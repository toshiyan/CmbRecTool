/**
 * This package contains the plotting 3d classes to plot a healpix map on a 3d sphere.
 * The java3d is used to create, interact and control a sphere geometry, appearance and behaviour.
 * You should have the java3d package installed in order to build/run the code. 
 * You can get it from <code>https://java3d.dev.java.net</code>.
 * It should be better to set the maximum heap space memory allocated to 512m if possible [run with -Xmx512m flag] - at least.
 * Under window, a good tip is to set -Dj3d.rend=d3d if you get an OGL exception error. 
 * Anyway, good tricks and tips about java3d can be found here: <code>http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=70&start=0</code>. 
 * The viewers are under healpix.plot3d.progs.
