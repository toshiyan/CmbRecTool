Fortran Library for Reconstructing Anisotropic Fields from Cosmic Microwave Background

This Library contains Fortran subroutines to reconstruct lensing potential, cosmic polarization rotation 
from cosmic microwave background anisotropies (CMB). In flat sky analysis, verification of the source code is shown in 

  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0091 for the temperature lensing reconstruction, 
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2372 for the polarization lensing reconstruction, 
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07855 for the cosmic polarization rotation, 
  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00169 for the delensing

In full sky analysis, the library also support the subroutines for the lensing reconstruction and delensing as shown in
